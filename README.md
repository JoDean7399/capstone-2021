    I chose to make this app because coding is something I am passionate about. I want people to get interested in coding and have fun while they're learning.

    I want to help people in honing their skills by testing them depending on skill level.

    I may look into making a more advanced quiz once I get more experience in coding myself. Maybe develop it so you're able to log in and retrieve your scores from a database.
