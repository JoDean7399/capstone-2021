# WELCOME TO ARE YOU A CODING WIZARD?

  I made this app while incarcerated. I built my apps without the internet. There is a button and modal on each of the quiz HTML pages commented out because in the transition from prison to home something has gone wrong. I also commented out the code that goes with the button and modal in the main.js. I am continuing to work on getting the button functional. I wanted to get my project on github to be able to show my work. Feel free to comment the code in to see what it looks like. The code in the main.js will console.log the information that will be displayed in the modal. Have fun taking the quizzes to see if you're a coding wizard!!


  This is a quiz app that...
   ## 1.GIVES YOU 3 DIFFERENT QUIZZES
        a. Beginner
        b. Intermediate
        c. Expert

   ## 2. TALLIES 
        a. Correct answers
        b. Incorrect answers
        c. Questions you timed out on
        d. Allows the user to put their name in a high scores table.
        e. Each page has a high scores table and the home page has a table showing scores for all three quizzes.
    
   ## 3. LINKS
        a. The homepage has links to reading material for all quizzes.
        b. Each page has links to reading material for the corresponding quiz.

    I chose to make this app because coding is something I am passionate about. I want people to get interested in coding and have fun while they're learning.

    I want to help people in honing their skills by testing them depending on skill level.

    I may look into making a more advanced quiz once I get more experience in coding myself. Maybe develop it so you're able to log in and retrieve your scores from a database.
